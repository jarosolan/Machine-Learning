Machine Learning Project

The aim of this project is to describe the methodologies used to perform Output Area Classification (OAC). The classification, based on the 2011 Census, places each Londonâ€™s output area into a group with those other output areas that are most similar in terms of census variables, hence areas can be classified according to their particular combination of characteristics. Three methods of clustering were applied to the dataset: K-means, partitioning around medoids and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. At the end all results are presented in the form of maps to provide better overview and insights.
